I'm a first-year CS Ph.D. student at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/). Previously, I received my M.S. degree at the [State Key Lab of CAD&CG](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/english.html), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), supervised by Prof. [Rui Wang](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/rwang/) and [Yuchi Huo](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/yuchihuo). I was also honored to collaborate with Dr. [Fujun Luan](https://luanfujun.github.io/) in [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/). I received the B.Eng. degree at [CS](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/), [ZJU](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english) in 2021. I was very lucky to do research with Prof. [Kai Bu](https://list.zju.edu.cn/kaibu/) during my undergraduate years.



## Research Interests

My research interests lie in the intersection between **computer graphics** and **computer vision**, specifically, in **3D representation and reconstruction**, **inverse rendering**, **scene editing and relighting**, **neural rendering**, *etc*. I used to research computer architecture and system security during my undergraduate years.

## Personal

- I love rock and roll music. I can't tell which band is my favorite, because there are too many!
- I enjoy playing table tennis (ping pong)üèì, and am trying to learn tennisüéæ now.
- I love photography, especially ecological photography (birds, plants, flowers, insects, wildlife, *etc.*) and macro photography. I'm a fan of Olympus [Micro Four Thirds (MFT)](https://www.four-thirds.org/) system.
- I enjoy reading literature, psychology and philosophy, but still a beginner. I wish I could have more spare time reading these extracurricular books!
